    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all of your ingredients and prepare the fish (clean and cut into steaks).</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a large pot over medium heat. Sauté onions and garlic until translucent.</li>
        <li>Stir in tomato paste and crushed tomatoes (if using). Cook for about 3 to 5 minutes, allowing the flavors to develop.</li>
        <li>Pour in water or fish stock. Season with salt, pepper, and add your hot pepper if desired. Bring to a simmer.</li>
        <li>Add the fish and chopped vegetables to the pot. Simmer until the fish and vegetables are partially cooked (about 10 to 15 minutes), then carefully remove them and set aside.</li>
        <li>Stir in the rice, ensuring it is evenly distributed. Reduce the heat to low, cover, and let the rice absorb the liquid.</li>
        <li>After about 10 minutes, gently place the fish and vegetables on top of the rice. Continue cooking until the rice is tender and the fish is fully cooked (another 10 to 15 minutes).</li>
        <li>Once everything is done, remove from heat. Let the dish rest for a few minutes before fluffing the rice.</li>
        <li>Garnish with fresh parsley or cilantro if desired. Serve hot, sharing both the fish and vegetables on top of the rice.</li>
        <li>Enjoy the hearty, flavorful taste of Senegal's national dish!</li>
