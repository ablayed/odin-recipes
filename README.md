# My HTML Basics Project

This repository contains a simple HTML-based website that showcases what I’ve learned from [The Odin Project’s HTML Basics lessons](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations). The goal of this project is to demonstrate fundamental skills in structuring HTML pages, using semantic tags, and organizing content effectively.

## What This Project Includes
- A **multi-page website** built entirely with HTML
- Examples of common HTML tags such as headings, paragraphs, links, images, and lists
- Simple navigation to move between pages

## Skills Demonstrated or Learned
1. **HTML Structure and Semantics**  
   - Using proper HTML tags to give meaning and structure to content  
   - Understanding the purpose of elements like `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<footer>`, etc.
2. **Working with Text and Media**  
   - Adding paragraphs, headings, lists, and images  
   - Embedding links and other interactive elements
3. **Basic Project Organization**  
   - Setting up a clear file structure  
   - Using descriptive file names and folder hierarchy
4. **Version Control Basics**  
   - Creating and managing a Git repository  
   - Writing meaningful commit messages

## Learning & Memory Tips (Reflections)
- **Struggling with Remembering Concepts**: It’s normal to feel overwhelmed by new tags and best practices, but building small projects and experimenting are the best ways to reinforce your knowledge.
- **Cheatsheets & Notes**: Keep a personal cheatsheet of tags, attributes, and their uses. Make quick notes of new concepts in one place to reference later.
- **Frequent Review**: Briefly revisit each lesson or topic every few days. This habit helps ensure that concepts stay fresh in your mind.
- **Teach What You’ve Learned**: Explaining HTML structures to someone else (or even just talking out loud to yourself) can highlight what you really know—and what you still need to practice.
- **Consistent Practice**: A short practice session each day or every other day can often have a bigger impact than a single, long session.

## Reflection
Working on this project has helped me:
1. Reinforce my understanding of basic HTML tags.
2. Gain more hands-on practice, which makes it easier to remember and apply concepts.
3. Identify areas where I need a quick refresher or more practice.
4. Realize the value of consistent and active learning methods.
